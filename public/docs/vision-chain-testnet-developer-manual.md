# Vision Chain Testnet: Developer Step-by-Step Manual (v2)

This manual guides developers on how to build, deploy, and verify applications on the **Vision Chain Testnet v2**.

---

## 🏁 Beginner's Path (No-Code Quick Start)
If you are not a developer and want to experience Vision Chain v2 immediately, follow this path.

### 1. Prepare Wallet & Private Key (MetaMask)
1.  Download [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for your browser.
2.  Create a new wallet or sign in.
3.  **How to Export Private Key**:
    -   Click on account name -> **Account Details**.
    -   Click **Show Private Key** and enter your password.
    -   Keep the `0x...` string secure (required for Step 5).

### 2. Register VCN Network
You must manually add the network to see your VCN balance.
1.  Open MetaMask -> Click Network Selection -> **Add network** -> **Add a network manually**.
2.  Enter the following details:
    -   **Network Name**: Vision Testnet v2
    -   **RPC URL**: `http://46.224.221.201:8545`
    -   **Chain ID**: `3151909`
    -   **Currency Symbol**: `VCN`
    -   **Explorer**: `https://www.visionchain.co/visionscan`
3.  Click **Save** to complete the registration.

### 3. Experience the Ecosystem
1.  **Acquire VCN**: Use the [Testnet Hub](https://www.visionchain.co/testnet) to request your first 10,000 VCN.
2.  **Send & Verify**: Send a small amount of VCN to a friend, then search your wallet on [VisionScan](https://www.visionchain.co/visionscan) to see the **AI-generated Accounting entries**.
3.  **Watch Live Traffic**: Visit the [Traffic Simulator](https://www.visionchain.co/trafficsim) to see real-time agentic interactions.

## 🛠️ Developer Path (Technical Integration)
For engineers building on Vision Chain, proceed with the technical steps below.

---

## Step 1: Network Configuration
To interact with the testnet, add the following network settings to your wallet (MetaMask) or development environment (Hardhat/Foundry):

-   **Network Name**: Vision Testnet v2
-   **New RPC URL**: `http://46.224.221.201:8545` (Cluster Gateway)
-   **Chain ID**: `3151909`
-   **Currency Symbol**: `VCN`
-   **Block Explorer**: `https://www.visionchain.co/visionscan`
-   **Cluster Status**: 5 Nodes Active (1 RPC + 4 Validators)

---

## Step 2: Acquire Testnet VCN (Faucet)
You need VCN to pay for gas fees.
1.  Navigate to the **Testnet Hub**: `https://www.visionchain.co/testnet`
2.  Click on **Request Faucet**.
3.  Your balance will be updated instantly through the Shared Sequencer and synchronized across the 5-node consensus.

---

## Step 3: Fast-Track Ingestion (v2 Sequencer API)
The v2 architecture allows you to bypass the traditional mempool for microsecond ingestion. Use the Shared Sequencer API to submit transactions with enterprise metadata.

### 1. Build a Transaction
Use `ethers.js` or `web3.js` to build and sign a standard EVM transaction.

### 2. Submit via RPC Gateway
Instead of broadcast, send the signed transaction to our Gateway:
-   **Endpoint**: `POST http://46.224.221.201:3000/rpc/submit`
-   **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "chainId": 3151909,
      "signedTx": "0xSIGNED_DATA",
      "type": "A110",
      "metadata": {
        "method": "Transfer",
        "counterparty": "Merchant-A",
        "taxCategory": "VAT-Standard"
      }
    }
    ```

---

## Step 4: Verify Accounting Metadata on VisionScan
Once submitted, you can verify your transaction and its accounting impact:
1.  Go to **VisionScan**: `https://www.visionchain.co/visionscan`
2.  Search for your **Transaction Hash**.
3.  Expand the **Accounting Tab** to see:
    -   **Journal Entries (Dr/Cr)** automatically generated by the AI engine.
    -   **Tax Category** applied to the transaction.
    -   **AI Confidence Score**.

---

## Step 5: Contract Deployment (Hardhat Example)
Deploying smart contracts to Vision Chain is identical to any EVM chain.

1.  **Configure `hardhat.config.js`**:
    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      networks: {
        vision: {
          url: "http://46.224.221.201:8545",
          accounts: [YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY]
        }
      }
    };
    ```
2.  **Deploy**:
    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network vision
    ```

---

## Step 6: Interactive Traffic Simulator & Stress Testing
The **Vision Traffic Simulator v2** is a live interactive environment for stress-testing your applications.

### 1. Interactive Simulation Sessions
1.  Access **Simulator**: `https://www.visionchain.co/trafficsim`
2.  **Initialize Session**: Click **Initialize Session** to start generating traffic. You can set a **Session Limit** (e.g., 500 TX) to automatically stop the simulation.
3.  **Real-Time Injection**: Unlike simple UI mocks, the simulator creates **ephemeral wallets** and submits real, signed transactions to the Sequencer.
4.  **TPS Control**: Use the **Manual Override** slider or presets (**Low, Medium, High, Max**) to adjust the injection frequency (up to 100+ TPS).

### 2. Advanced Metadata Toggles
Test how the AI engine processes complex accounting data by enabling toggles:
-   **Accounting Metadata**: Attaches detailed journal entries and tax classifications to the transaction.
-   **Cross-Chain Route**: Simulates inter-chain asset routing contexts.
-   **ZK-SNARK Proof**: Appends synthetic zero-knowledge proof data for privacy-preserving verification testing.

### 3. Developer Overrides
Use the **Deployment Parameters** panel to focus traffic on your specific stack:
-   **Target Contract**: Set your deployed contract address.
-   **Custom Method**: Define the method signature the simulator should call.
-   **Protocol Choice**: Select between `A110`, `S200`, `B410`, or `R500` to simulate different transaction types.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Mixed Content Blocking (Empty Transactions)
If VisionScan appears offline or doesn't show transactions despite being on the correct network:
-   **Cause**: The site uses HTTPS, but the current Testnet API uses HTTP. Modern browsers block these "Mixed Content" requests.
-   **Solution (Chrome/Edge)**:
    1. Click the **Lock icon** next to the URL.
    2. Go to **Site Settings**.
    3. Find **Insecure content** and set it to **Allow**.
    4. Refresh the page.

## Step 7: Cross-chain Bridge
Vision Chain v2 supports seamless asset migration between disparate networks.

1.  **Deposit (L1 → L2)**: Send tokens from an external Ethereum Testnet (e.g., Sepolia) to the Vision Bridge entry point.
2.  **Withdrawal (L2 → L1)**: Initiate a return flight for your assets back to the source chain via the L2 Bridge interface.
3.  **Proof of Migration**: All cross-chain movements are indexed and verifiable via **VisionScan**.
