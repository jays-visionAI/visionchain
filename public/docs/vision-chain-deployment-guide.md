# Vision Chain Testnet: Developer Step-by-Step Manual (v2)

This manual guides developers on how to build, deploy, and verify applications on the **Vision Chain Testnet v2**.

---

## 🏁 Beginner's Path (No-Code Quick Start)
If you are not a developer and want to experience Vision Chain v2 immediately, follow this path.

### 1. Prepare your Wallet (MetaMask)
1.  Download [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for your browser.
2.  Create a new wallet and securely back up your **Recovery Phrase**.

### 2. Connect to Vision v2
1.  Open MetaMask -> Click Network Selection -> **Add Network Manually**.
2.  Enter the following details:
    -   **Network Name**: Vision Testnet v2
    -   **RPC URL**: `http://46.224.221.201:8545`
    -   **Chain ID**: `3151909`
    -   **Currency Symbol**: `VCN`
    -   **Explorer**: `https://www.visionchain.co/visionscan`

### 3. Experience the Ecosystem
1.  **Acquire VCN**: Use the [Testnet Hub](https://www.visionchain.co/testnet) to request your first 10,000 VCN.
2.  **Send & Verify**: Send a small amount of VCN to a friend, then search your wallet on [VisionScan](https://www.visionchain.co/visionscan) to see the **AI-generated Accounting entries**.
3.  **Watch Live Traffic**: Visit the [Traffic Simulator](https://www.visionchain.co/trafficsim) to see real-time agentic interactions.

## 🛠️ Developer Path (Technical Integration)
For engineers building on Vision Chain, proceed with the technical steps below.

---

## Step 1: Network Configuration
To interact with the testnet, add the following network settings to your wallet (MetaMask) or development environment (Hardhat/Foundry):

-   **Network Name**: Vision Testnet v2
-   **New RPC URL**: `http://46.224.221.201:8545`
-   **Chain ID**: `3151909`
-   **Currency Symbol**: `VCN`
-   **Block Explorer**: `https://www.visionchain.co/visionscan`

---

## Step 2: Acquire Testnet VCN (Faucet)
You need VCN to pay for gas fees.
1.  Navigate to the **Testnet Hub**: `https://www.visionchain.co/testnet`
2.  Click on **Request Faucet**.
3.  Your balance will be updated instantly through the Shared Sequencer.

---

## Step 3: Fast-Track Ingestion (v2 Sequencer API)
The v2 architecture allows you to bypass the traditional mempool for microsecond ingestion. Use the Shared Sequencer API to submit transactions with enterprise metadata.

### 1. Build a Transaction
Use `ethers.js` or `web3.js` to build and sign a standard EVM transaction.

### 2. Submit via RPC Gateway
Instead of broadcast, send the signed transaction to our Gateway:
-   **Endpoint**: `POST http://46.224.221.201:3000/rpc/submit`
-   **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "chainId": 3151909,
      "signedTx": "0xSIGNED_DATA",
      "type": "A110",
      "metadata": {
        "method": "Transfer",
        "counterparty": "Merchant-A",
        "taxCategory": "VAT-Standard"
      }
    }
    ```

---

## Step 4: Verify Accounting Metadata on VisionScan
Once submitted, you can verify your transaction and its accounting impact:
1.  Go to **VisionScan**: `https://www.visionchain.co/visionscan`
2.  Search for your **Transaction Hash**.
3.  Expand the **Accounting Tab** to see:
    -   **Journal Entries (Dr/Cr)** automatically generated by the AI engine.
    -   **Tax Category** applied to the transaction.
    -   **AI Confidence Score**.

---

## Step 5: Contract Deployment (Hardhat Example)
Deploying smart contracts to Vision Chain is identical to any EVM chain.

1.  **Configure `hardhat.config.js`**:
    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      networks: {
        vision: {
          url: "http://46.224.221.201:8545",
          accounts: [YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY]
        }
      }
    };
    ```
2.  **Deploy**:
    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network vision
    ```

---

## Step 6: Stress Testing & Custom Scenarios
Unlike static simulators, Vision Chain allows you to build and push **Custom Traffic Scenarios** to test your specific contracts.

### 1. Configure via Dashboard (UI)
1.  Access **Simulator**: `https://www.visionchain.co/trafficsim`
2.  Input your **Target Contract Address** and **Method Name** in the *Developer Override* panel.
3.  Set your target **TPS**. The simulator will now prioritize transactions that interact with your contract.

### 2. Build Your Own Environment (CLI)
You can connect your local test suite (Hardhat/Foundry) to the simulator to visualize your own traffic:
1.  Initialize a traffic loop in your script using the Sequencer API.
2.  Tag your transactions with a specific `appId` or `metadata.context`.
3.  The **Live Feed** in TrafficSim will automatically pick up and label your environment's traffic based on the metadata.
