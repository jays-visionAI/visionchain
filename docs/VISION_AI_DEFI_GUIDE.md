## 💎 Key Capabilities

### 1. Alpha Discovery (DeFi Yield Scanner)
Vision AI now scans thousands of liquidity pools, lending markets, and staking protocols across multiple chains (Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, etc.) to find the highest APY for your assets.
*   **Prompt Example**: *"Where can I get the best yield on my USDC right now?"*
*   **Prompt Example**: *"Find me ETH staking pools with TVL over $100M."*

### 2. Intelligent Risk Assessment
High yield often comes with high risk. Vision AI now performs a heuristic security audit on protocols before suggesting them to you.
*   **Prompt Example**: *"Is the Lido protocol safe to use?"*
*   **Prompt Example**: *"Analyze the risk level of Aave on Polygon."*

### 3. Historical Performance Analysis
Compare today's opportunities with historical data to make informed decisions.
*   **Prompt Example**: *"Compare BTC price growth over the last year versus the average DeFi stablecoin yield."*

## 🛠 How It Works

Vision AI uses **Real-Time Data Injection** and **Autonomous Tool Execution**:
1.  **Intent Parsing**: Our AI understands financial context, not just keywords.
2.  **Tool Orchestration**: It calls specialized services (CoinGecko, DeFi Llama) to fetch live data.
3.  **Risk Filtering**: Heuristic engines evaluate TVL and volatility to score opportunities.
4.  **Insight Synthesis**: The AI summarizes complex data into clear, actionable advice.

## 🛡 Security First

*   **Non-Custodial**: Vision AI proposes transactions; you sign them. We never have access to your private keys.
*   **Transparency**: Every advice piece comes with data-backed reasoning.
*   **Risk Warnings**: The system explicitly flags protocols with low TVL or emerging statuses.
